# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Garden Grove is a gardening app that will aid in building and maintaining a successful garden by removing the intimidation of starting a garden we hope to get more people gardening, and make it fun and easy in the process.  We will accomplish this by giving our users information convenience, plant organization, and maintenance scheduling.  Our app will be used by people who are looking to start a new garden and users that have started and are looking to get organized in their gardening.  We expect users to use our application on the go, at home in the garden to take the research and guess work out of how to maintain your garden by having readily available information that is focused towards the plants that the users have in their personal gardens. 

## Stakeholders and Users

- Garden Centre business' (such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot, etc.)
  - Primarily a stakeholder
  - These centers will have an increase in customers
  
- Garden Center Customers
  - Primarily a User
  - Could use our application to make shopping easier
  
- Garden Center employees
  - Potentially a User or Stakeholder
  - Could be experienced gardeners themselves
  - This can free up the time of the employees at the Gardening Center
  - Make them more effective at their job
    - They can help customers in advanced ways rather than holding their hand while making a suggestions for plants
    - Help customers with actual problems
  - Less Stress / Avoid Irate Customers or help
    - Customers are more informed so it will allow them to not feel intimidated when talking to employees
    - Customer knows what they want
    - Less reliance on employees
    
- Home Gardeners
  - This is the primary user in mind
  - Beginners
    - Help beginners to garden by providing a way to get the necessary information to care for plants in their garden
  - Experienced
    - Supplement to their gardening knowledge. It can help to lighten the cognitive load of remembering
      how and when to maintain every different plant of their garden
 
- Earth
  - Primarily a stakeholder
  - More people planting gardens will help the environment
  - More people could grow their own food
  - Less lawns and more trees/plants/flowers being planted
 
- Farmers 
  - Primarily a stakeholder (We aren't targetting people who mass produce plants for profit)
  - People who grow the flowers/plants to be sold at retailers
  - Higher demand for their products

## User Research Methods

The three research methods we used were an Interview, the Try it Yourself Technique, and Secondary Research.

Interviews are a good way to talk with a user or stakeholder in a more intimate way.
People can express their frustrations and suggestions while the interviewer can also
learn from interviewee. Our application is concerned with gardening, particularly helping
beginners and experienced gardeners. Interviewing those who have gardening experience
can give us insight into what techniques and workarounds worked for them to maintain a garden, which we
can include into our design.

### User Research Method 3: ...

Try it yourself method was selected because a member in the group had previous experience with gardening and we felt first hand experience in starting a new garden would be beneficial in the design of a gardening app.  The experience level of this person also aligned with our research goals, as the person had started gardening a year prior, and are finding out new items from what happens after starting a garden, and the struggles with starting a garden with no experience.  
 
This member starting out with no experience went into gardening with no research because they felt that "gardening is easy" I dont need to do research.  They started with a blank slate and went at it.  There planting and planning methods we unorganized and seemed to go with the flow with watering schedules and maintenance.  After a year of planting their garden, 13 of the 18 plants planted survived, and some plants that should haven been tended to after the seasons end should have been tended to but were not. 
 
From this research we found that after a year of gardening the user did not have an accurate account of what plants they had planted as the tags that came with the plants originally were dicarded and any information on the plants were lost.  The user did not commit the new plants to memory before tossing the tags.  Other takeaways from this experience would be that the user had no idea how to plant the items they had properly without guidance from the people who worked at the garden center.  Not all plants are planted in the same manner, for example their experience with planting their orchid may have gone wrong if the garden center employee did not inform them othe proper method ahead of time.

- Do It Yourself:
 
  - **Subject:** Philip Borowoy
 
  - **Experience at start:** None 
 
  - **Experience at end:** 1 year, starting year 2
 
  - **Garden Size:** 4 gardens 2’x 3’
  
  - **Plants:** Tree (type forgotten), hostas, other plants/flowers that are unknown, herbs
 
Why I got into gardening, to improve the look of my house.  Existing garden beds were not maintained and overgrown, had existing structure, might as well do something with it.
 
I grow herbs for cooking and to save money, or that was the plan, then only parsley grew from all the seeds I bought, am currently starting new plants: chives, tomatoes, oregano
 
  - **Tools Owned:**
 
    - Wheel Barrow 
    - Various shovels
    - Flexible Rake
 
  - **Tools Bought:**
    - Tiny planting shovel
    - Weed killer
 
I was buying tools as I had money (I planned to start gardening ahead of time) / needed them for other reasons
 
  - **What I did in the beginning:** 
 
I had no idea what I was doing so I looked online for a garden center in my area, didn’t want to goto home depot, thought the employees at a specialized garden center would have better employees, looked for a non busy  employee that didn’t look like a young adult at a summer job, because they would most likely have knowledge of plants as they more likely are a long term employee.  Found one and it worked, she had other work  but to do but  didn’t look too busy she was very nice and helpful and showed plants based on what I was trying to do/colour scheme , the size of the space I was planting in, and also showed me what to look for on the tags when shopping for plants.
 
  - **What I first found out:**
 
They sell plants that are not suited to be planted in Calgary, you have to look at tags and they tell you the “zone” of the plants are suited for.  I first thought that if someone is selling outdoor plants in Calgary they are suited for being planted in Calgary outdoors.  
Perennials are plants that come back the next year, they were in a different section than plants that don’t come back each year, still not sure if this is common in big box stores
 
There were 3 different price points that plants are sold at the garden center, depending on the size of the plant 
 
Wal-Mart sells mulch a ¼ the cost of the garden centers, I have not noticed a big difference in the price of the plants, trees, flowers in the big box stores I have shopped at compared to garden centers expect for dirt, mulch, grass seed, things along those lines garden centers give you a huge advantage in selection compared to big box stores
 
  - **My Experience:**
 
Planting these plants was easy enough I had planted a few trees before for my parents so the tree went in good.  Flowers and low lying shrubs I have never planted before but I followed the same general planting procedure for all the plants as I did for the tree, except the orchid, which the lady who helped me told to plant shallow with the bulb exposed from the top of the soil when I planted it.   I was skeptical but it survived the winter.  
 
Right off the bat a few plants just didn’t seem to take, nothing I tried seem to bring them back from wanting to die.  Found out plants that you buy that die in the first year are eligible for a replacement plant, so I took a picture of the sad looking twigs in the ground that were the remaining pieces of the plant, found out they wanted the actual root system or no refund.  Makes sense.
 
Of the 18 plants I originally planted 13 are still around.  I thought less, but more keep popping up , so maybe more are alive but haven’t sprouted much for the new season. 
 
There is one plant that I should have trimmed I think over the winter or maybe this spring, still need to but the plant is growing fine without it so I am leaving it for now, maybe those branches come back later.
 
I still have no idea what I’m doing, but learning things all the time.
 

  - **Beneficial takeaways from this method:**
 
Not remembering what the plants I bought are sucks I probably could do some searching to find them but not that concerned.  The little tag they give you gets lost and is it something they really expect you to keep or even stick next to the flower in your garden?  Is that what you are suppose to do? Am I doing it all wrong? 

Losing the tags I had no idea what to do for maintenance at the end of the season or what to do at the beginning of next season.

After everything was planted and growing, I was not happy with my planting layout and wanted to switch around the location of some of the plants. Spacing was a bit of a problem some plants we much larger and not what I expected after they were established and grew during the season.
