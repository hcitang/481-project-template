# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

Garden Grove is a gardening app that will aid in building and maintaining a successful garden by removing the intimidation of starting a garden we hope to get more people gardening, and make it fun and easy in the process.  We will accomplish this by giving our users information convenience, plant organization, and maintenance scheduling.  Our app will be used by people who are looking to start a new garden and users that have started and are looking to get organized in their gardening.  We expect users to use our application on the go, at home in the garden to take the research and guess work out of how to maintain your garden by having readily available information that is focused towards the plants that the users have in their personal gardens. 

## Stakeholders and Users

- Garden Centre business' (such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot, etc.)
  - Primarily a stakeholder
  - These centers will have an increase in customers
  
- Garden Center Customers
  - Primarily a User
  - Could use our application to make shopping easier
  
- Garden Center employees
  - Potentially a User or Stakeholder
  - Could be experienced gardeners themselves
  - This can free up the time of the employees at the Gardening Center
  - Make them more effective at their job
    - They can help customers in advanced ways rather than holding their hand while making a suggestions for plants
    - Help customers with actual problems
  - Less Stress / Avoid Irate Customers or help
    - Customers are more informed so it will allow them to not feel intimidated when talking to employees
    - Customer knows what they want
    - Less reliance on employees
    
- Home Gardeners
  - This is the primary user in mind
  - Beginners
    - Help beginners to garden by providing a way to get the necessary information to care for plants in their garden
  - Experienced
    - Supplement to their gardening knowledge. It can help to lighten the cognitive load of remembering
      how and when to maintain every different plant of their garden
 
- Earth
  - Primarily a stakeholder
  - More people planting gardens will help the environment
  - More people could grow their own food
  - Less lawns and more trees/plants/flowers being planted
 
- Farmers 
  - Primarily a stakeholder (We aren't targetting people who mass produce plants for profit)
  - People who grow the flowers/plants to be sold at retailers
  - Higher demand for their products

## User Research Methods

The three research methods we used were an Interview, the Try it Yourself Technique, and Secondary Research.

Interviews are a good way to talk with a user or stakeholder in a more intimate way.
People can express their frustrations and suggestions while the interviewer can also
learn from interviewee. Our application is concerned with gardening, particularly helping
beginners and experienced gardeners. Interviewing those who have gardening experience
can give us insight into what techniques and workarounds worked for them to maintain a garden, which we
can include into our design.

### User Research Method 3: ...

Try it yourself method was selected because a member in the group had previous experience with gardening and we felt first hand experience in starting a new garden would be beneficial in the design of a gardening app.  The experience level of this person also aligned with our research goals, as the person had started gardening a year prior, and are finding out new items from what happens after starting a garden, and the struggles with starting a garden with no experience.  
 
This member starting out with no experience went into gardening with no research because they felt that "gardening is easy" I dont need to do research.  They started with a blank slate and went at it.  There planting and planning methods we unorganized and seemed to go with the flow with watering schedules and maintenance.  After a year of planting their garden, 13 of the 18 plants planted survived, and some plants that should haven been tended to after the seasons end should have been tended to but were not. 
 
From this research we found that after a year of gardening the user did not have an accurate account of what plants they had planted as the tags that came with the plants originally were dicarded and any information on the plants were lost.  The user did not commit the new plants to memory before tossing the tags.  Other takeaways from this experience would be that the user had no idea how to plant the items they had properly without guidance from the people who worked at the garden center.  Not all plants are planted in the same manner, for example their experience with planting their orchid may have gone wrong if the garden center employee did not inform them othe proper method ahead of time.
